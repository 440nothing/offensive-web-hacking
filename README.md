# Offensive Web Hacking – by @440nothing

This repo documents my research-driven workflow for manual recon, JavaScript exploitation, XSS chaining, and offensive post-exploitation.

## 🔬 What I focus on:
- Subdomain recon with API-enhanced tools (Subfinder, httpx, Katana)
- Manual JS parsing to identify tokens, endpoints, legacy patterns
- DOM & reflected XSS, especially via `location.hash` and old jQuery
- OAuth/token bypass and session fixation (in progress)
- Custom bash scripts for high-signal recon

## 📁 Structure

- `/methodology/`: Documented approaches (Recon → JS → XSS → Exploit)
- `/tools/`: Bash scripts, config files, and Nuclei templates
- `/writeups/`: Redacted or fictionalized reports and PoCs
- `/PoC/`: Screenshots, payload templates, live test cases
